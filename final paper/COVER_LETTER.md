Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript titled "Computational Based Comparison of COVID-19 Vaccine Sentiment Between Occupational Groups on Reddit in 2021" for consideration for publication in your journal.

## Summary

This study examines how occupational identity influenced online discourse regarding COVID-19 vaccinations during the 2021 vaccine rollout. Analyzing 846 posts and comments from 17 profession-specific subreddits, we employed a large language model (Gemini 2.5 Flash) for sentiment classification and found a statistically significant divergence between white-collar and blue-collar communities.

## Key Findings

- White-collar communities exhibited significantly more negative sentiment (M = -0.24) compared to the near-neutral blue-collar cohort (M = -0.01), with p < 0.001.
- Substantial intra-category variation was observed, with hospitality workers (r/KitchenConfidential) showing positive sentiment while machinists showed strongly negative sentiment.
- Qualitative analysis revealed that negativity often reflected concerns about mandates, legal frameworks, or personal health anxieties rather than vaccine efficacy.

## Significance

This research challenges monolithic narratives about vaccine hesitancy by demonstrating that occupational context—not just political affiliation—shapes online health discourse. These findings have implications for tailoring public health communication strategies to specific professional communities.

## Declarations

- This manuscript is original work and has not been published previously.
- This manuscript is not under consideration for publication elsewhere.
- All authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission.
- No conflicts of interest exist.
- This study used publicly available, anonymized data from Reddit and did not require IRB approval.

## Supplementary Materials

The following supplementary materials are included with this submission:
- Supplementary Figures (time series, interaction plots)
- Anonymized dataset
- Analysis code repository

We believe this work will be of interest to your readership in digital epidemiology, public health communication, and computational social science.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
