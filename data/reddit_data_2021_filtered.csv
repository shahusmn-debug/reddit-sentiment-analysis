I caught covid really badly in March 2020.   
Since then I have had a lot of recurring health concerns relating to sinuses, lymph nodes being swollen, lethargy, headaches etc etc.  
I was put on antibiotics for a while when my sinuses swelled up and was causing me discomfort. Never experienced that before.  


I have noticed a serious change in my tinnitus since contracting the virus, with low frequency hum coming and going too (I clocked it at 67hz).  


Ever since I had my Pfizer vaccine my HF tinnitus is all consuming. It's off the scale.

Then a week later I went on vacation in kenya and during this vacation it got even worse (maybe malaria medicine which can cause/worsen tinnitus).
I never thought it would be because of the pfizer vaccine so I took my second shot (4/08) and now (6/08) i am kinda of scared that this will make it even worse. I will try to keep you updated on my condition.

t1_h8zv76n,KitchenConfidential,blue_collar,comment,"Agreed, wholeheartedly. I was a skeptic until I just said “fuck it, I’ve trusted science my whole life this isn’t the hill to die on just because it’s new.” 

I think there a lot of people in that camp, who initially thought “it’s just the flu.” Every rational adult knew by April or may “this is different.”

I think a lot of us went and marched at BLM rallies, saw everyone in masks, and wondered “how can such a simple thing be so effective? Why are people mad about MASKS right now?”

Hated wearing it. Months on end, hated it thinking “I’m over this, can we go back to the way things were? It wasn’t even good, but this is worse.”

Then the vaccine started getting distributed. A lot of people said “oh thank god” and a lot of people said “uh, that seemed kind of quick. Do we know what the long term effects may potentially be?”

THEN, we found out a lot of people who get Covid have long term issues because of it. Looks like a lot of them are chronic. Maybe this was known earlier, but I didn’t hear about it until after the vaccine came out. 

I remember thinking “this seems a little too convenient.” I felt that MUCH stronger after initial reports came out that 99% of Covid deaths were now the unvaccinated. 

The moment of clarity actually came after I got my second dosage. I felt like I had been hit by a truck. Maybe this is just blatant scientific ignorance, which would follow the themes of my rambling here, but all I could think was “goddamn, if this SHOT fucked me up this bad, imagine what the virus might do.”

I got the shot because I figured “well, the chances of it hurting are basically (functionally) zero. Worst case scenario it doesn’t HELP. Those numbers that seem “convenient” could just as easily be interpreted as “this vaccine is functioning exactly as intended.” Which option seems more likely?

My boss told me not to touch him the day after my second dose. He thought I would give him Covid because of “shedding” or whatever nonsense he had read. Over drinks the other day, which puts me 2.5ish months since my second dose, I mentioned how the numbers seemed “convenient” and he practically *shouted* “THANK YOU” while gesturing. We had already talked about “you and your kids already got vaccinated for a bunch of stuff” which struck him as an “oh yeah” moment. I mentioned that a lot of people are uncomfortable with this vaccine because it’s new, and he had a few things to say about that. I mentioned the chronic side effects of the virus itself which were just now finding out about, likened them, and posited that the virus sounds worse than anything the vaccine may potentially do.

I wish formatting were easier on mobile but after all that, I brought up how it seemed convenient. He very quickly revealed he shared that belief, among others I hadn’t heard before. Nothing about microchips, just bunk science. 

I then said “or, the vaccine is just doing exactly what it’s supposed to.” 

I wish I could share that moment with everyone who thinks the conspiracy theorists and anti vaccine crowd are a lost cause. His entire demeanor changed from hyped up and angry to “hmm, yeah that would kinda make sense too.” I could literally feel it wash over him from across the table. I don’t want to misquote him but he said, with a heavy sigh, “maybe you’re right.” Along with some other things. I said “idk man, if a bunch of Turkish dudes in Germany say it’s safe, I believe them over some article on the internet.” Something silly and (probably) inaccurate like that.

This is all starting to sound preachy in my eyes, but the point is that it’s worth trying to bridge that gap. There are a lot of people who just felt unsure and insecure because of this whole situation. That’s how crazy people gain power when, in retrospect, it’s so obvious where things are headed if we allow disinformation to go unchecked.

Nobody is right now 100% of the time, but sometimes you can see someone slipping and pull them back before it’s too late. I’m crazy in all sorts of ways, but at the end of the day any and all conspiracy surrounding Covid is just that. It’s honest science trying to tell us “please, let us make this go away” while a bunch of scared and selfish adults stamp their feet like 2 year olds and say “NO!”

The vaccine makes us far less likely to *contract* Covid, but it does not guarantee that we will not be capable of *carrying* the virus.   
There is a big difference there that you are clearly not grasping.    
I can still *carry* the virus and not get sick from it. Which means I can have it and pass it on to my lazy-ass roommate who can, in turn, pass it on to other lazy fucks.   
Odds are very much in my favor that if I were to contract the virus, I would be *far* less likely to *die* from it than the selfish unvaccinated idiots.    
It's not about ME getting the virus and dying from it, it's about me being responsible for passing it on to other people who won't - or can't - get vaxxed.

The pay rate is pretty attractive, equal to a starting salary with holidays.

All that being said. There are more jobs open than people willing to work. And the US is hovering around 59% vaccination rate nationally.

So there's a mismatch of more people who are vaccinated but still unwilling to risk going back to in person jobs.

Conclusion: you shouldn't have any issues finding vaccinated candidates. Your restaurant is a private business and is absolutely allowed to mandate conditions of employment that aren't discriminatory.

Better wages than majority of places avg $20/hour, benefits, well staffed compared to majority of places in the area.

Vaccines are not mandatory for employees, just the new PPE.

Only one unvaccinated person working at the time, requests a meeting complaining about this. Walks out after the meeting. Next day 2 more unvaccinated employs and the first one all come back in, threaten to walk. We offer to pay for them to do research or for time to go talk to a doctor wether they should get it or not. We also pay for time missed work for getting the vaccine. 

Management doesn't budge on the face shield unless fully vaccinated or doctors note. The 3 staff decide it's better to walk. Next head chef gets in a pissing match with office management, gets canned. 2 more employees get in same argument, same result.

Edit: I know the stereotype for kitchens are ""grunge heads"" but like are there people this stupid to pass up this amazing place that actually treats there employees right. I've worked in alot of small shitty restaurants and sometimes they don't know how good we have it.

t3_pnj8kl,KitchenConfidential,blue_collar,post,"(covid) Feeling like shit because of masks? I know this is a doozy, but needed to ask some industry opinions if anyone else feels this way:

Im vaccinated, our entire staff is vaccinated, as of today our entire customer base will be vaccinated (nyc law.) Our customers dont need masks at all at our restaurant, but our HR department is still mandating all staff wear masks at all times. Am I wrong to be upset with this policy continuing? We all did our part and got vaccinated, we all wore masks for over a year and a half at our work on a hot ass line.

Context: We are a restaurant that's part of a small restaurant group of 5 places. We have an HR department that determines our masking. We removed the masks 2 months ago for about a week before bringing them back. NY hasnt really had anything change covidwise and it really bothered us that HR just brought them back out of the blue

It just feels dehumanizing that we have hundreds of rich people come in for hours everyday, where we slave away food for them and they dont need to wear any masks. But the kitchen crew working a 10 hour shift right next to eachother do. I just feel like it's theatre for us. We are vaccinated. We get tested. I just want to move on and dont see how we will ever move on if we are told it's ""abundance of caution.""

Sorry, Ive just been down since we brought it back. My ears bleed end sometimes from the mask cutting in. I go upstairs to shit and see a full dining room of people unmasked besides myself. We had an HR rep come by to do a routine catching up with chefs, and they didnt even have a fucking mask on their face when doing it. I just feel like we wont ever move past it if work from home people decide that we have to wear it (even when they only do on subway.)

It was such a happy moment when we moved past the masks as a sign of progress and normalcy for the kitchen, but it just feels like we are never going to be normal again since it makes some people feel better to see us line rats masked up. I just thought vaccinating everyone would finally end this shit",17,48.0,1631551489.0,pnj8kl,2021-09-13 16:44:49+00:00,negative,-1
t1_hcpngi8,KitchenConfidential,blue_collar,comment,"> But the kitchen crew working a 10 hour shift right next to each other do.

This is probably their reasoning. A customer will be in for an hour. You guys are all packed in close to each other for ten hours. 

The virus is transmissible even when vaccinated. So if one of your coworkers has been exposed and has any kind of viral load, he or she has ten hours to breathe it around the kitchen. Wearing a mask keeps their exhalation close to them and helps protect you against breathing anything in.

And if customers can see you guys cook, they could be looking to make a good impression.

Not saying I agree with the policy of only kitchen staff wearing a mask, but I'd bet this is their thinking.",43,,1631552956.0,pnj8kl,2021-09-13 17:09:16+00:00,neutral,0

What are the odds that one of your vaccinated coworkers gets covid, has no symptoms, spreads it to you, and your vaccinated self has a serious illness? About as close to zero as a statistic could be.

Masks are no big deal to slip on when you go to the grocery store. They're a massive pain in the ass to wear all day at work. You have to touch your face and now wash your hands *every single time* you get a drink of water. Your voice is muffled and you can't read lips which is especially annoying when trying to speak with coworkers who aren't fluent in English - a common occurrence in kitchens. It's harder to catch your breath if you're doing something laborious and harder to cool down if your kitchen is hot af.

Masks were necessary before vaccines were available. Now they're pointless unless you're feeling unwell. In which case you shouldn't be out and about anyways. You have a right to be frustrated about BS hygiene theater.",-1,,1631566962.0,pnj8kl,2021-09-13 21:02:42+00:00,positive,1
t1_hcqa1ow,KitchenConfidential,blue_collar,comment,"As the models showed last year when scientists were trying to understand the virus, ventilation and air circulation is much more important and a better predictor when it comes to spread. Timing is not. A single unmasked customer that's in the restaurant for even 5 minutes but coughs or speaks loudly is a much bigger threat than a single customer eating by himself in a corner for even an hour or two. I believe this was actually one of the contributing vectors that caused covid to explode in China initially — a single customer coughing indoors where the air was not being circulated outwards but internally, infecting the entire restaurant.

Given that most customers are unmasked while eating and the closed-off atmosphere of most indoor restaurants, the burden should still be on the customers if we're going by the ""any kind of viral load"" logic. A single cough or yelling from a vaccinated but unmasked customer still puts the entire restaurant at risk, let alone the staff that'll be there for 5+ hours.",7,,1631562184.0,pnj8kl,2021-09-13 19:43:04+00:00,neutral,0

The externalities of being vaccinated and a carrier are no longer the same. At worst, if you're vaccinated, you will develop mild flu-like symptoms (with an added risk of temporarily losing your taste or smell). 

Like you said, there's a lot we still don't understand about the virus in terms of long-term side effects, but the risks you say you're paranoid about are  realistically extreme edge-cases where contraction is confounded with a host of other pre-existing medical issues. If you fall under this category, then you should stay home and get things delivered or pick up curbside.

But to me, there's no world where the reunion of 20+ vaccinated people should be reconsidered or shamed because 1 person out of the 20 has confounding medical issues — that 1 person should stay home.",-1,,1631563367.0,pnj8kl,2021-09-13 20:02:47+00:00,positive,1
t3_rpyqr6,KitchenConfidential,blue_collar,post,"Dear Diary, Santa brought Omicron to the Rockies Today, Christmas Day 2021, was probably the most challenging day of my entire career. I have said that so many times during the past two years, that it almost bears no impact on me anymore and my tiny violin I play to myself at night. 

Those momentary solitary pity parties feel like some coddling form of self care - a brief moment where I acknowledge that what I’m doing to myself, my body and my mental health is all just absolutely crazy and unsustainable but I somehow have to accept it because it’s all relative to everyone else’s experience. The burnout is a badge of honor right? It means I “put in work”, “pulled weight”, “hustled hard” ‘cuz I’m a “boss bitch” right? (Gag). 

It’s also that moment in the quiet morning when you scroll on your phone at all the top headlines and you get down to the bottom and it’s just sitting there. Squatting like a toad. “New variant appears in South Africa and is three times as transmissible”. 

When omicron first started making headlines only a few weeks ago as a “highly transmissible variant like we’ve never seen”, the hairs on my neck stood at attention. That voice inside said “we’ve been here before”. 

Being isolated in the mountains with no snow and off-season, we were safe. But snow was coming and so were the powder chasers and the influx of tourists for the holidays wanting to escape to the Colorado Rockies. 

I made booster appointments for myself and my partner (who is also my chef de cuisine, my right hand, left hand, ride or die). We could not go down! There was no way in hell we could miss 10 or 14 or however many days before the holidays and we had already rescheduled our boosters twice due to work conflicts. It was the first time in a very long time that I had made a decision to prioritize our health over our job. And I caught flack for it at work for us both taking two days off on our lowest volume days when the main dinner service was closed. Go fucking figure. 

We had to drive to Idaho Springs to get Pfizer -  an hour and twenty from our employee housing in Vail. Twenty minutes into the drive, my GPS estimates an arrival time 3.75 hours later. They had closed I-70. On a bluebird day with perfect roads with temps in high 40’s, I looked at John and said “we’re not bailing. I don’t care if this takes 8 hours round trip. We took this day off to get our shots and tomorrow to recover and then we’re back to work full speed ahead, no days off until January”. 

A week later, my pastry chef tests positive. Cool. No prob. We get his part time assistant set up to work OT and he truly rose the the occasion. He’s good people. He stayed out a few days to wait for test results. Negative. Perfect. 

Fast forward a week - my employees start complaining of symptoms. Our company policy is for them to isolate and return to work symptom-free after testing. So, I started buying rapid tests in early December. I purchased tests at Walgreens when I picked up my monthly prescriptions. I ordered some from the State. I shared the link for free rapid tests from the Dept of Health with everyone I knew. I had started amassing a supply almost like I knew where we were headed. I bought masks, started Purelling everything, shoving wipes into hands and reminding everyone to clean phones and POS touch screens and cooler handles and…when everyone else started dropping off or calling off and they needed tests - they called on me. “Chef has some”. Yeah. Chef has been blowing the war horn on the mountain for a month! 

Going into Christmas, I started slowing my prep levels. I knew we didn’t need to prep for 300+. I was right. Sure enough I watched reservations drop. It felt like March 2020 all over again. 

Christmas Day, I got in at 6:30am. My morning crew was already buzzing and getting breakfast ready. I was feeling good knowing we didn’t need to do much - Christmas Day was just a rinse and repeat of Christmas Eve. Same menu, same prep. And we were stocked. I made my rounds Purelling - handing surgical masks out to replace the “sustainable and uniform” cloth masks we were given. Might as well be wearing panties on faces. I wiped down the ice machine like the health department was standing over me and an IRD server showed up. I saw her post a pic on FB of a thermometer reading 102°F the day prior. I asked her how she was feeling. “Don’t worry, Chef. I’m on a ton of over the counter meds”. I track down my director and drill him about it being 24hrs since her fever broke. He assures me she tested negative. Fine. Whatever. It’s still cold and flu season, dick. She fucks up a massive IRD order and while I’m trying to make sense of it, a breakfast server tells me she feels “nauseous” and has a headache. I flag my boss again. He has one last test in his office. It comes back negative. I breathe a sigh of relief and offer her some ibuprofen, which I’ve been told not to do, but I don’t care anymore - I need everyone to just be okay for one goddamn SECOND. 

11AM rolls around and my banquet chef shows. She’s my other key player. She tells me she has a sore throat. Many of my AM staff have little ones at home who can’t be vaccinated. I can’t take any chances for them. It’s my responsibility to keep my mama’s feeling safe at work. I tell her the inevitable and she reluctantly goes home. 

I start pivoting for the day knowing I’m down a chef. Two chefs actually because my pastry chef is on day 7 of quarantine after a positive test. I see our intern walking around frantically looking for something in my walk-in. I ask her what she needs and she says “waffles for owners lounge”. “Where is Maria?”, I said. “I am covering for her so she can cover front desk because the entire desk is out with Covid”. I then find out that so is HR, our GM, and our “director of special projects” or whatever made up title they gave to someone to retain them thru this shit storm. “Great”, I thought. “Now they are pulling from F&B to staff the rest of the hotel. As if that would ever go the other way.” I felt a brief moment of pride that we were the healthiest department on property. At least I’m doing one thing right. 

Back to planning for the day, I contact my CDP and let him know not to go too hard on the mountain because he’s working the other kitchen that serves the bar/IRD/pizzas with just one J1 (who has 7 whole days of kitchen experience). I hit up my partner/CDC and ask him when the heck he was coming in because I was already feeling the undertow. “Oh and I sent Courtney home”. “Okay!”, he replied like he already knew. 

We got thru about 60 for dinner after 120 in the AM before I started to feel the wall. I was on hour 13 after having a two hour break where I cried twice, sent lengthy chastising emails to HR copying all the PiC’s I could think of, walked to dog and napped 30 minutes. Now I was back managing expo on 3 hours of nightly sleep with no off days and these 16-17 hour days were starting to take its toll. I’m used to 80 & 90+ hour weeks and high volume but when you’re already understaffed and then lose even more…how? How do we keep this up?

Too many ppl started to ask questions at once. They know to ask to call when I’m on expo, so I just kept giving them the finger. “Hold please” I said, to pretty much the entire room as my grill cook, who was helping my CDP in the other kitchen, threw his phone on the pass. Positive. I looked at him empathetically and said “are you okay? you gotta go home bud”. He shouldn’t have even been there. I had no idea he had gotten a PCR test. His rapid test in my office came back negative but I should have sent him home two days ago knowing he’d been exposed. But that’s not our “new and improved policy”.  He was exasperated but went quickly. I resumed the barrage of questions and bullshit special requests. It started soaking in - the rate at which I was losing key team players. 

I started losing my place on expo.  My
CDC was holding down the entire line with another brand new temp and a young green J1 while I fumbled to get back on track. I started to realize how hot I was. And the sharp pain in my throat. Was that there before? “Chef I have to leave at 9:30. The last bus is at 10. They are cancelling routes because of staffing”. “Okay, I’ll take you home”. “Chef, our dishwasher takes the bus too”. “Okay, I will take of you all home. No one leaves tonight until we finish all together”. There was no way in hell I was making morning deal with this. We couldn’t keep snowballing. 

Now I was nauseous. Was this exhaustion or symptoms? Whatever is was I sure as fuck wasn’t going to say anything, which made me feel even worse - like I was keeping a horrible secret and going against everything I had been PREACHING fuck. “I’m such a fucking fraud what the hell are we doing here?”

My CDP who was holding down the other outlets comes to the pass and says “Chef we need to talk”. I called offline and gave him my full attention. “We smoked together earlier”, he said, talking about my grill cook. I said “you were tested?” “Yeah two days ago and tested negative. He tested today and was positive”. I emailed leadership and they said to make him keep working. I wanted to cry for a third time. 

I came back to the main kitchen to expo confusion. Our bar manager said “how long on course 1 for 23?” As I rifle thru freshly printed tickets still on the printer to play catch up. I find 23 and look at the clock and holler back to him thats it’s been only four minutes! John, plating course 2’s feverishly yells “you can fuck right off man get the fuck out of here” as the bar manager swings open the doors to the dining room. I pulled down my mask to mouth a thank you to John. 

Minutes later, same bar manager storms in and says “cancel desserts on 41”. He slams something into the dish pit and I beckon for him to come to the pass. “What’s up?” I said. And he rattled off the symptoms the table said they were having and needed to leave immediately. Even the guests in the dining room were dropping like flies. 

Once we had a break from the printers, I pulled my outlets director to send an email to my boss. I was furious when he relayed to me that I could no longer require testing for employees and that because my CDP wasn’t showing symptoms, that he needed to keep working. He was exhausted. I could see it. And now I had to tell him that despite everything I had been telling EVERYONE else, HE needed to keep going. 

We were all-in with no open in the main dining, so I started helping him break down. He started the night with four people to help him and by the end, it was me and him. He nodded along to everything I was saying. I kept telling him over and over how much I appreciate what he does, and that I need him to check in with me mentally and that I will never let it get to a point where we are carrying this place on our backs. I’m not dying on the cross for this job. We will modify menus and hours, limit reservations and capacity, do everything we can to put up one last fight before we lose this battle. 

I got him out of there just as my CDC was finishing. We met in the office and he pulled out a bottle of Redemtion rye. You can’t buy alcohol on Christmas Day in Colorado. Sneaky boy bought it from the bar manager when they had a cigarette to hash out the shift. 

“I fucking couldn’t do this without you.” I said, and we took some shots, broke down the dish pit, went home, did our own dishes and laundry and went to bed talking the whole time about how proud we were of our people and how we can’t keep doing this to them. We can’t keep doing this to ourselves. 

That night, my F&B Director (a former chef) calls me and says he’ll work grill until my grill cook is back. “We’ll do this together”. We commiserated - I felt supported. This morning, we talk again. The plan has changed. Dinner is suspended for 3 nights. We re-open Thursday for NYE weekend. We’ll stay open for breakfast, IRD and the bar (which has a full menu). No alterations to menus or capacity limits and we keep the employee cafe open. Oh and I find out two servers from Christmas Day tested positive. Her roommate is my AM server today. 

So now, after I made so much noise, my FOH management all has days off this week, my staff needs days off, and here I am working four hours less each day at least (10-12hrs now) but still with no day off in sight because my staff can’t do this without me by their side.

Anyways, last week, one of the servers was sent home when the boss noticed that they were very clearly sick (probably not covid, because everyone is vaccinated, but some of these residents can't even handle the common cold). Everyone on staff was ordered to get a rapid covid test, and later on in the week, the person in question 'quit' the job. 

Today, in a meeting with badass-boss-lady-chef to go over the results of a recent health inspection, it was revealed in not so many words that the server who went home sick was actually fired for ""falsifying documents"".

In the Netherlands the government cannot mandate a vaccine, unless parliament passes it (hepatitis B vaccine is mandatory for certain jobs for example). But at the moment there is not even a chance that would ever pass for COVID-19, so it is not a topic. This means no one is mandated to take the vaccine, not healthcare workers, police officers, college students, etc.

But also at an individual leve, so employers, it is not possible. So private hospitals and colleges cannot mandate it, as it violates two constitutions (privacy and physical integrity). They do not have a right to know if you are vaccinated and cannot force you to do something to your body. So mandating vaccination is impossible. An employer can ask if you are vaccinated and ask you to get vaccinated. But attaching any negative consequences to not obeying or answering the employer is violating your constitutional rights. Also, they are not allowed to story any information regarding your vaccination status.

t1_hgsnyqe,ProtectAndServe,blue_collar,comment,"This is an escalation between Chicago city leaders - notably mayor Lori Lightfoot - and some police officers opposed to a vaccine mandate. An interesting point brought up by the union is this is to some extent changing the terms of officer's employment; it would feel more palatable if as part of initial employment officers were told they must maintain vaccine status based on CDC guidelines. It's also interesting in that police, unlike most other professions, are not legally allowed to strike to protest what they see us unfair treatment. Refusing to provide proof of vaccine could be viewed as intentional work stoppage.

The benefits of the vaccine are indisputable, even if it's detriments over the long term are not necessarily known. Overall I narrowly support the ability for employers (of any sort) to mandate medical requirements for the safety of other staff and customers. That said, the idea of giving employers the ability to mandate personal medical decisions sets a somewhat unsettling precedent, and I feel if I wasn't personally pro-vaccine I would feel differently and my opinion here is not completely unbiased.

It's not unreasonable to say ""if the people I interact with are worried about the virus, they should get vaccinated, not me"". At a systemic level, this causes problems because of hospital capacity, but that doesn't seem a good reason to legislate individuals act a certain way; using this thought process you could criminalize things like obesity. But if systemic impact is taken into account, you could easily view the mandate itself negatively, should a large portion of the already strained Chicago police force be forced into unpaid leave for their beliefs. If the justification for the mandate is that ""it saves lives"", in this case, it might not.

I also wonder - if the determination is that a lack of a vaccine poses a significant health risk to those you interact with, is it not also within officers' rights to demand people they interact with (arrests, witness statements, etc) have the vaccine as well? Already precedent exists that police and medical officials need not perform otherwise life saving actions if those actions may place their own health at risk.

Being vaccinated drastically decreases the chance that you will require hospitalization if/when you contract the disease across all variants, which of course means your symptoms are significantly milder. Of course your chance of dying front the disease also drops (by a factor of 10).

I believe (less certain about this part) the milder symptoms also mean you are less likely to transmit the disease as well.

(Edit after doing some research)

Looking at large numbers of individuals: with the vaccine, you are significantly less likely to contract COVID in the first place. If you do, your are less likely to be hospitalized, and if you are hospitalized, less likely to die. Of course being less likely to contract it means less likely to spread it as well, which alleviates much of they pressure on the hospital systems.",13,,1634355258.0,q8za2s,2021-10-16 03:34:18+00:00,positive,1

I don't think anyone that's not in CPD right now understands fully the level of demoralization that has happened within the past two-three years.  This is one of the first times in a long time that the average cop has had the opportunity to stick up for themselves and their brothers.  Right now over 75% of the department is refusing to report their vaccination status, even though about half the department is already vaccinated.  This is 100% about sending a message, not about whether the vaccine is safe.

Again, this is the result of a relentless blow after blow to morale. Literally no one even tries to hide their complete animosity towards coppers, including the command staff.  I don't think it's a small coincidence that the membership is fighting this thing so hard and it's being spearheaded by Eric Carter, the 2nd in command.  Eric Carter is the guy who a month and a half ago got on a radio a few hours after an officer was killed and said ""we're not waiting for that shit"" in reference to the bagpipes and honor guard coming to escort the ambulance carrying the fallen officer.  Nobody in the department ever came out and tried to offer an apology or explanation.  The mayor basically said there was nothing wrong with what he did.  I think for a good deal of the department it was a wake up call to how fully the city and department give no fucks.  Now all the emails telling officers to comply with this bullshit are coming from him and his office.  No copper in the department will forget what he did for as long as he lives.

And everyone in the department realizes it's a fucking joke that the city is now trying to act like there is concern over officers health related to covid.  When the pandemic hit, there was no PPE, no gloves, not even basic masks.  Cops were pooling their own money to buy sanitizer and masks for their watches.  For months, there was no sanitization of equipment and when it was done it was done by department members because the city wouldn't hire actual cleaning crews.  During the riots and looting and all the other cancelled days off and 12 hour days, officers were packed like sardines into vans and buses for hours on end.  Bosses were still asking for activity and arrests, which obviously means making officers come in contact with the public.  Coppers still had to answer calls and deal with crowds, mostly in communities that literally did not abide by a single Covid protocol.

All that was okay, right?  But now we're going to act like there's a big concern over the risk of having any percentage of the department be unvaccinated?  This was all just another attempt by the city to show how it could further break down the morale of the department.  They thought they could start fucking with cops' paychecks and everyone would tuck their tail between their legs.  The city found out the past few days there's only so much you can push before there is a push back.",40,,1634362173.0,q8za2s,2021-10-16 05:29:33+00:00,negative,-1

We have vaccines heading out, and we have people with at least some form of natural protection from already having Covid. Hell there are most likely people who have had Covid and didnt even know it. 

Who we should be worried about getting the vaccine? People 65 and older which currently over 82% are vaccinated which makes them 94% less likely to be hospitalized if somehow they did get infected.  Next if you are in at at risk category you probably should be vaccinated. 

But I would say by end of June people have had ample time to to decide if they want the shot or not and at that point all restrictions need to go. Vaccinated people have a 90% chance of being protected from infection, and even if there is an infection symptoms are dramatically reduced and hospitalization let alone death is extremely rare. Hell, at one point there were 85 million people who received at least one dose of vaccine and out of those 85 million 5k got reinfected.  Those are some pretty dam good numbers. 

I could see people who dont fall in the at risk category (under 65, healthy) not wanting to take a chance with a shot. And especially since many places still require masks and other prevention measures even for vaccinated people which I truly believe these mandates are in place even for vaccinated people so people cant try and skirt health guidlines without being vaccinated.",32,,1620068867.0,n421zo,2021-05-03 19:07:47+00:00,positive,1

It caused seizures due to inflammation in the brain and left me with with epilepsy. Luckily, I had a remarkable outcome and came out with no other problems. In terms of seizures, it starts to become odd. I never actually had any seizures coming out of the hospital once I recovered. I guess possibly 2 small ones when weaning off medication but it was debatable and even then, if they were it wouldn't have been abnormal. I was completely fine for a year and then when I got the vaccines things changed. Both doses lead to a grand mal seizure and the little medication I was on from all the continuous weaning now changed. It has been basically known for me that the first was due to a high wean of Vimpat with the vaccine while the second was the intense immune response from the body. Sad part is, although there is great certainty that is what caused them, we cannot 100% percent say due to safety reasons. Its been months now since and I've been completely fine and back to driving. As you can probably gather from all this, I have a weird case. I'm basically fine and probably will continue to be fine but I have questions.

&#x200B;

I'm currently in college finishing up my biochem degree just to have a back up and have a bachelors degree. Plan was to finish it and go to the academy or possibly look into the Fed side of things. Of course, I have epilepsy now and I have medication I take so things are different now. My father has been an officer for a long time and now detective who is close to retiring. He has told me no one will hire you and that they will find ways to not and I've asked him what about the Federal side and he mentioned, although he doesn't know how they do things entirely, he said based off the website for hiring, same thing as anyone else. He said if you're off all medication and go years without anything then he said go right ahead, but he said as it is now basically forget about it. I guess my questions are:

1. it is possible with someone with epilepsy to be a police officer? Could you even get into the academy?
2. do the Feds hire differently compared with others with problems like these?
3. Is there any other options I can look into for law enforcement? One problem, and the big one he said, is driving since as an officer that's a lot of your job so is there jobs in law enforcement where that isn't the main focus but still doing field work?

**Translation:**

#  A day of riot police at Museumplein

>I worked on Museumplein *(a square in Amsterdam)* yesterday. Among other things I was in charge of cordoning off the corner 'Van Baerlestraat - Paulus Potterstraat', confining about 100 people in the Vossiusstraat and transporting detainees in the city buses to the cell complex. This year marks my tenth anniversary with the ME *(Dutch riot police)* and in those ten years, I have seen and heard quite a few people demonstrate.  
>  
>In the ME you apparently develop some schizophrenia. In recent years I have been called out for being a racist, a fascist, a murderer, a child rapist, a drugged-out soccer hooligan, and a whore of the law. Added to that yesterday were NSB-er *(Dutch Nazi party during the second world war)*, Nazi, slave to the corona dictatorship led by Rutte *(Dutch prime-minister)*, and traitor to the freedoms of the Dutch people. Besides, my family must surely be proud of me, that as a soldier of the Globalists I am beating up defenseless citizens.  
>  
>Do I care that people say this to me? Let's just say that I remembered lesson 1 of 'social skills in police school' well 15 years ago: ""People swear at the uniform, not at you."" That sounds pretty floaty, but I must say it has been a lesson I carry with me my entire police career. Keeps it cool between the ears.  
>  
>After seeing the footage, looking at Dumpert *(Dutch video sharing site)*, newspapers, and 'The bill from Jan' *(a blog)*, it turned out that there was no demonstration at all on Museumplein, but rather innocent people going out for a cup of coffee. Now I'm very curious to know where you can get a cup of coffee at the Museumplein, because I think all bars and restaurants are closed, including those around the Museumplein.  
>  
>It turns out that the police were completely wrong and arrested 150 people completely unnecessarily. These people didn't hurt a fly.  
>  
>The same people think that Willem Engel *(anti-corona measures frontman)* is going to be the prime minister of the Netherlands. People who think that the Netherlands is an LLC started in England. People who think Rutte is fucking little kids and drinking their blood. People who think that the Netherlands is a sub-province of Germany and therefore not governed.  
>  
>These kinds of creative minds taught me one thing yesterday; on March 17, 2021, I will vote for the party that is most committed to investing in the mental health sector. Because when corona is over, those people will get busy.  
>  
>Is it forbidden to demonstrate? No, it certainly isn't.  
>  
>Is it forbidden to be critical of politics given the corona policy? No, certainly not.  
>  
>Is it forbidden to be exhausted with all the corona measures? No, it certainly is not.  
>  
>But is it, therefore, permitted to go to Museumplein armed with a blackjack and then use that blackjack against police horses?  
>  
>But is it, therefore, permissible to pull stones out of the ground and throw them at the police, with the risk of seriously injuring someone?  
>  
>I used to have a season ticket to Ajax *(Amsterdam soccer team)*. I went along to away matches and was so fanatical that I was heartbroken when they lost at home to NAC *(a smaller soccer team)* (it happened quite often in those days). Grim times, that's for sure. But I knew that if the ME stood in line in front of you, equipped with a baton, helmet, and shield, you had to be out of there. So I never got hit. So I've never been able to whine on social media and Twitter about the police coming down so hard on me after an Ajax match.  
>  
>Look, I would also have liked my Sunday to be different. I would have liked to have been lying on the couch with a big bowl of spare ribs on my lap watching Ajax - Feyenoord *(another big soccer team)*. In retrospect, it turns out I didn't miss much, but it's the idea. The Classic is a match you want to see. And since I survived the bloodless 0-0 of Frank de Boer's Ajax in 2015, the 2021 edition couldn't have been much worse than that match.  
>  
>Back to the city bus for a moment, where I could easily follow how three men were talking to each other. All three in their late 40s, maybe over 50. The gentlemen were talking to each other about the Netherlands, about Rutte *(Dutch prime-minister)*, and about how the country was doing. One had heard from people at the police union that the cops were all done enforcing the corona rules. Another had heard something again from the State Attorney, the statement about the vaccine that would change the DNA and that there was a chip in your body. Yet another said that the hard cores *(hooligans)* of Ajax, ADO Den Haag and Feyenoord *(soccer teams of the three big cities)* were organizing to fight together against the government.  
>  
>It's just that I was wearing a mouth mask, otherwise, they would have seen me laughing in their faces. I think that a gay couple will be able to walk through Teheran hand in hand even sooner than the supporters of Ajax, ADO, and Feyenoord will be able to join forces.  
>  
>After hearing so much chatter I became quite corny. When you're waiting on a bus like that, even as an ME officer you sometimes have a chat with these guys. I had already let it be known that I was going to have myself vaccinated when it was my turn and that I felt sorry for the person who was going to monitor me when I got a chip in my body. I told them that I have such a boring life that those who would have to monitor me would have an even more boring life. The best part was yet to come.  
>  
>One of the three asked what was going to happen at the cell complex. I couldn't resist making a joke of it and saying that they would all be vaccinated against corona at the cell complex and then allowed to go home. I would indeed have liked to have spent my Sunday differently yesterday, but the look those guests got at my joke made up for everything.  
>  
>Keep thinking by yourself dear people. Don't just run after someone. Don't believe every podcast or YouTube video.

t1_hiplinc,Firefighting,blue_collar,comment,"Just as a little context, most of this job had Covid. Per the union, over 70% of firefighters tested positive either for Covid or for the antibodies. Plenty of others never got tested for either. I don’t know a single member who didn’t have it. It ripped through firehouses back in March 2020, back when there was nothing we could do about it. When it went through my house, I took it as a given that on my next tour, I was getting covid. Sure enough. Brought it home to the wife and kids as well.

Regardless of what happened to firefighters in other parts of the country, and despite almost all of us getting it, there was exactly one active firefighter here who died of covid. He was 61, working an offline gig, and I believe he had heart issues.

We also have a strong union. Some of the comments here indicate that others have far weaker unions or no concept of a union at all. Regardless of vaccination status, many members feel the city should have met us at bargaining table to discuss this instead of unilaterally imposing it.

Now throw in that yeah, there are a fair amount of right wingers laboring under misapprehensions about the vaccine. They also have right wing ideas about freedom, that is, placing the supremacy of the individual over just about anything. Which is a little weird for unionized public sector workers but the end result is, arguments about getting vaccinated for the greater good, especially against a virus they and their families already had, carry little water.

Of course, it's overblown.  That's the nature of these things.

As a young ff, I used to fight tooth and nail against the “anti” crowd, now I just accept that my friends and co workers and I don’t align morally, politically, or philosophically. 

We had a recent , well respected, retiree just die within a week of contracting COVID, I hoped that it would change some guy’s mind about the vaccine, but no, they are dug into their belief system and media outlet. 

I’ve come to accept that my thinking and feelings are the minority, I’m not changing their mind, they certainly aren’t changing my mind. It’s certainly not worth the argument. They know my stance, we mostly agree that politics ( which the vaccine has become) are off limits when I’m around. I guess It helps that I’m a senior Lt.

I have come across this post – *“I've been working full time for the past few years in consulting. I've been struggling with mental health issues for most of my life, I was diagnosed with clinical depression at 16 and take still take medication for it. Over the last few years, I've invested every ounce of energy trying to stay afloat at work and still struggle. I've realised that there is something fundamentally different about me - something that's causing me these problems but I haven't resolved it, it's becoming alot worse.*

*Over the last few months, my anxiety levels and lack of drive has broken through the facade I put on at work….*

*I've decided that I need to take a break - I'm hoping that my company will offer me some unpaid leave, otherwise I need to leave the company altogether.”*

I am in a similar situation as OP now & is considering an 1-month unpaid leave.

Context:

1. I have been in a project for 6 months. 2 weeks ago, I started feeling burned out & due to the side effect of vaccinations, finding it harder to wake up earlier for calls. I still force myself to do so, but start to take two 1-hour breaks each day (including lunch time, which I usually have to skip due to work). I thought this will be ok as I had completed all critical & major tasks in the past few months, & now I am left with menial tasks  (daily reporting & remind people to do their job).
2. A SM whom I have been helping attentively for months & who is at least aware of the vaccination's side effect issue, clearly discommends that I am slow in replying his non-urgent messages due to my breaks. After I told him I feel tired, he changed overnight, escalated about my performance issue & started to throw in some other retaliation tactics & verbal abuses. All within the past 1 week.
3. And yet I also found out that my stay has been extended for another 2 months. I asked my CC whether an earlier roll off is possible, but there's no reply, yet. I am more demoralized now...

What’s fortunate for the OP is that he can share his mental health issue. For mine, this is a taboo. I am also fearful to look for the next opportunity - I am scared that I will run into such managers again.

Honestly, I feel embarrassed that I am so crippled mentally now to even think properly, as my anxiety has been exacerbated. I found out that a 3-week notice is required for unpaid leaves, but I have no idea what reason to state so it won't be shot down easily. Should I just resign without a job first? Though stupid, I feel like I have to leave if the unpaid leave is refused…

Any advice/ focus point that I should take note of before applying for the unpaid leave? What would be the most reasonable steps to take now? Any advice would be really appreciated, thank you.",16,26.0,1639721102.0,riaoni,2021-12-17 06:05:02+00:00,negative,-1

1. Your side effect is either made up or if it is true this is not a side effect that of the millions and millions of people that have taken the vaccine have gotten in any meaningful number. basically no one cares about ur made up side effect so don't try to use that with your company they will laugh at you.
2. Why would you quit now? Sounds like you are through the tough part of the project and about to get 2 month extended to do some cushy BS work. Why would you want to roll off to a new project when you are ""burned out"". Make zero sense.

My advice stay on this easy project and use the next few months to find a new job. Do not try to use ur vaccine tired thing for any sympathy no one cares we are all tired.

t3_mu0ny2,cscareerquestions,white_collar,post,"Candidate: If you don't provide a flexible working environment post pandemic I'm not working for you. Companies: *surprised Pikachu* My company has had major financial troubles since the pandemic began. So I've slowly been looking for work over the past few months. My wife works too and we live well below our means and have a lot in savings so there's no rush. 

What I've encountered is a lot of misleading job postings and/or offers regarding working remote vs. in office post pandemic. For example:

- Posts labeled as remote then in the description ""remote until after covid"". Bait and switch nonsense. 


- Companies already back in the office for months, well before vaccines. 5 days a week in the office was expected even though they did well with people working remotely. 


- Companies offering flex between in office and remote during the initial interviews, but backpedal as you interview further


-  One company who said ""your entire team has to determine whether or not you can work from home that day"". Yeah, because I want a committee to decide whether or not I can leave my wife home alone with a strange contractor who is working on the house that day. Fuck that. 

So some of these places I bailed early, and others I bailed after I got an offer and got the real truth in the final interviews. Their reaction was always the same, total shock that I would remove myself from contention or turn down an offer because I was unable to choose my working environment. Some even reached out to me twice and sent me surveys asking what happened (I never respond to these, they know already). 

Full disclosure, I just want flexibility to determine whether or not I want to be in the office that day, or remote, or full remote. Trust is an important part of any relationship, and right away if I don't have that trust from an employer than our relationship is already off to a bad start. I don't want to be treated like a baby and/or lied to. 

Also there is a massive financial cost to consider with owning an extra vehicle/gas/wear and tear/and above all time when commuting. That is a huge financial factor that I just can't gloss over as a candidate. 

So yeah, talented candidates are going to shop around for flexibility in the future and companies will either have to adapt or get left behind. Remote flexibility is not only the future, but the present in tech. 

What do you think is the future of employees who demand flexibility like this? Have you turned down offers due to remote or lack thereof?",1829,590.0,1618839099.0,mu0ny2,2021-04-19 13:31:39+00:00,neutral,0

And started to regret about declining Pfizer offer, and eventually called manager about asking the offer back.

t3_ol0dna,cscareerquestions,white_collar,post,"[UK] My employer is expecting everyone to return to the office once fully vaccinated - what are my options? The UK government COVID-19 guidance is being relaxed on Monday, 19th July. Meaning the legal obligation to ""work from home where possible"" is no longer required. Instead the government are instructing for a gradual return to work.


We have successfully worked remotely for the past 16-months. However, my employer is expecting (requesting) that anyone who has been fully vaccinated (+2 weeks) to return to the office.

There will also be restrictions put in-place for health & safety whilst in the office:

* no socialising/groups
* avoid in-person meetings where possible
* eat at your desk or off-premesis (the office canteen remains closed)
* + daily health-questionnaire & PPE requirements

In my opinion, these limit any benefits of returning.

Many employees do *not* wish to return to the same regime as they had pre-pandemic, as they have realised the benefits of working from home - including reduced commute times, more time spent with family/friends, more flexibility, etc.

On the other side of the coin, I'm aware that many people *are* eager to return to the office, as they benefit from the more social environment, or may not have a suitable arrangement at home, or any other reason.

If I want to remain remote, do I have any options from a legal standpoint?

There are a couple of *obvious* options to me:

* Accept that I'll be required to return to the office and put up with it.
* Hand in my notice and find a new job.

I had a 2 offers (Chevron and Pfizer) – Analytics positions. And i went with Chevron, told Pfizer ""sorry, but i've went with other offer"". After 2 weeks working at Chevron, i've started to notice that job is super easy but very boring. And started to regret about declining Pfizer offer, and eventually called manager about asking the offer back. He told me "" i need to discuss it with colleagues, then he came back with saying colleagues were a bit shocked, but we still are willing to extend offer to you. however, on our terms, which is you join us in 2 weeks. (instead of 2 months, which they were willing to give in 1st place). And i agreed to it, saying i promise i will join you this time.

However, now i realize that i was too quick on jumping to conclusion. Since Chevron now gave me a very interesting project, which engages me fully and with potential to get bonus monthly (so it's extra $$). And now i don't really want to switch jobs and wanna stay here for a while.

My all my friends and family says ""you gotta keep your word and go work for that Pfizer guy, since you gave a word and on top of that he went to vouch for you before his colleagues, so you gonna let him down and + karma might hit you for doing such unethical thing"".

Chevron – $2,500 a month, 1 month work(without weekends) and 1 month off, 12 hours a day and + potential to get bonuses every month +$2,000. So basically if you work hard enough , you make $4,500 a month.

It could have a code or something in it that tells them who sent it. Sorry. Paranoid. This is also posted on teamblind.com with several companies in it. 

https://www.teamblind.com/post/Mandatory-vaccination-Z7JyrTfc

Says all government contractors over 100 employees have to have employees vaxxed by December 8th. This is only for government contracts. Biden did order OSHA to make a rule that requires all companies over 100 employees(I think that is the size) to require vaccinations, but from what I read OSHA works a lot slower. 

This is all companies over 100 employees that have any government contracts. Does not have to be solely or mostly a government contractor. DC tech market is going to HOT in January. Even if just 5% of people get fired over this. DC is a pretty blue area, I do not expect that many people to be unvaxxed. Most of the market is government contracting and/or companies that have government contractors and have to require vaccinations. 

I don't know how many people will be out over this. I doubt it will be 25% like the NYPD. But it could mean January is a good hiring time. January is usually dead. 

This only attacks government employees. There is a post on teamblind about other companies. Cisco just announced it. Id expect Microsoft,Google,Amazon. I don't see how this impacts Netflix or Apple (does apple have government contracts?). Does facebook have a classified facebook? If not, it won't impact them.

Others that hire developers Cisco, Dell, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, IBM, VMware, and MANY MORE. 

I am a damn mercenary. Going to use this to JOB HOP AND GET MORE MONEY. YEAH I SAID IT. This mandate is MONEY. Especially in the DC area. 

I am not going to post the oracle email. I don't know if there is any kind of special code in it that would tell them who got what email. Sorry

t3_nogzem,cscareerquestions,white_collar,post,"Bachelor's Degree, Unemployed For Years, Zero Work Experience, Stuck. Preface:
I’ve read through a lot of the faq’s and kind of had a few of my questions answered but not sure if I should leave them just so you can get a better picture of my whole situation.  Also I’m unsure if those answers would be different now considering some of those threads are 5-7 years old and the landscape could be dramatically different, what with covid and all.

I have a BS in computer science from the University of Washington: Tacoma and I also live around the Seattle area.  I graduated two years ago and intended to take a few months off.  Before I knew it, I had spent two years doing nothing.  

Most of the time I feel like I suffer from imposter syndrome but then I'll visit subreddits like this one and feel like I really do know nothing.  I'll come across job search horror stories on the front page of Reddit from people who applied to hundreds of jobs with little to no success and they have great qualifications and experience, of which I have none.  I was a pretty good student but I assume the real world work in this field is nothing like solving the random problems you do in class.  If it indeed is like solving advanced algorithms and using calculus on a daily basis then I'm in even more trouble, even though I passed and got the degree.

I've had a burst of motivation recently and want to get back on track.  I have zero experience in the field and have no idea where to even begin.  It's all so daunting but I need to start somewhere.  Like school assignments, the hardest part for me is just getting started.

What I have going AGAINST me:

* I have zero work experience in the field, not even internship(s) 
* I now have a huge gap in my general work experience and understand that's frowned upon greatly
* I don't know what to put in the projects section of my resume as I haven't really done much outside of school projects, of which all the other students have done so I can't differentiate myself from the competition.  Any projects I have done on my own are mostly incomplete or just very simple programs that I made for fun that relate to my life.
* I've undoubtedly forgotten a lot from school, but could probably pick it back up if I grind/refresh for a few weeks.
* Computer science is very broad and I'm unsure what type of job I should be applying for or even where I should be looking (LinkdIn, Indeed, etc?)
* I live in the Seattle area and assume the competition is way beyond me
* I have huge confidence issues but at the same time I don't want to sell myself short.  I've never had a job where I had to negotiate my salary/benefits.  I'm afraid of getting stuck in a job where I'm being taken advantage of.  I really have no idea what my worth is.

What I have going FOR me:

* I got a degree.  I almost burnt out in the last year of college and I don’t think I can/want to get a master’s degree.
* Some might think I'm lazy, but I'm actually a hard worker and can grind/focus for long periods of time.
* I was a pretty good student.  Not the best, but maybe top 20-30%?
* I live in the Seattle area and although competition must be high, there's hopefully lots of jobs?
* I'm vaccinated, have transportation, and don't mind working in an office/cubicle.  Although, I do like Washington and want to remain local and not move out of state for a job.

Thanks so much if you actually took the time to read all that.  I could have added more but this is just what I can think of off the top of my head.  ANY advice is greatly appreciated! :)

**tldr**: Have a degree, unemployed for years, no work experience in the field, no idea where to begin.  Any help appreciated!

edit: I'm receiving quite a few replies and want to thank each and every one and also every new one!

edit 2: I'm using a throwaway account so I'm going to make an edit now in case I lose access to the account.  I think I've gotten a better perspective on my situation and myself thanks to all your replies.  Here's a list of some of the things I plan to do from here (not necessarily in order):

* Highly consider therapy (have to get insurance sorted out, see what's covered, if anything)

* Go through all my assignments in college and see what I'm proud of or which projects demonstrate desirable traits and add them to my resume

* Get back into the coding mindset.  Maybe learn to make some simple apps that I can use.  Practice (Leetcode, Codecademy, freecodecamp.com, etc)

* Finish my resume and LinkedIn profile.  Add a bunch of people on LinkedIn that have tried to reach out to me.

* Apply anywhere and everywhere

* After an indefinite amount of time if I'm having zero success or improvement, consider boot camp options (A number of people suggested this but I can't deal with the cost right now). 

* Thanks for helping me",77,56.0,1622398531.0,nogzem,2021-05-30 18:15:31+00:00,neutral,0

t1_hhbakow,law,white_collar,comment,"Given the legal basis cited in the primary Executive Order, of which all subsequent EOs, policies, and guidelines reference - no, the President cannot mandate vaccines.

* EO 13991 ([link](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/01/25/2021-01766/protecting-the-federal-workforce-and-requiring-mask-wearing)) cites 5 USC 7902(c) where the President is able to establish a safety council (named the Safer Federal Workforce Task Force) \[sub clause 1\].
   * There is a second sub clause wherein the President may ""undertake such other measures as he considers proper to prevent injuries and accidents to employees of the agencies.""
   * We can assume that the President is acting under sub clause 1) given that he created the safety council referenced previously.  Even if such an assumption is not correct, the limits of legal power described here still hold.
* Such a safety council has ""advisory body to the Secretary"" as its charge per this same statute.  After receiving advice from the safety council, the Secretary then can recommend policy changes to the Department of Labor (presumably then through OSHA)
* The term ""employee"" is referenced and further defined in 5 USC 8101 - this definition seems to limit scope of the Secretary of Labor's actions to just federal employees, not contractors.
* The safety council has the authority under this statute to advice the Secretary of Labor ONLY, yet they are publishing guidance and policy directly to the federal agencies, and now through the most recent EO to contractors. ([link 1](https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov/downloads/updates%20to%20model%20safety%20principles%209.13.21.pdf), [link 2](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/M-21-25.pdf))

The above argument should be clear enough to show no legal basis under the cited authority referenced in the EO, but if it's not, consider that the safety council is co-chaired by three Deputies in ""Acting"" Director positions.  It should stand that the Acting Directors are exercising authority far outside their powers. ([link](https://www.saferfederalworkforce.gov))

t1_hkqabrt,law,white_collar,comment,"The Biden Admin. messed up by not having everything ready to go when they first announced the mandate months ago.

This was implemented as an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) via OSHA due to the ""grave danger"" unvaccinated workers posed to themselves and others.

An ETS is meant to be used on the rare occasion that there is such an imminent, grave danger that the government has to issue a stop-gap fix until a more permanent measure can be implemented. This is similar to governors having emergency powers at the onset of the pandemic last year.

It is not meant to be used as a workaround in lieu of actually legislating, which is what WHCOS Ron Klain retweeted and the court considered a WH endorsement.

&#x200B;

Here is the timeline of events:

Sept. 9- POTUS announces OSHA mandate

Nov. 4- Details of the mandate announced

Jan. 4- Vaccination deadline

&#x200B;

Looking at this timeline, there is a four month span between when this mandate was announced and when it will be implemented, and there was a two month span between when it was announced and when any actual details were revealed.

Yes, COVID-19 is serious and remains a threat to American lives. But is hard for the federal government to argue ETS due to 'grave danger' if it takes five months to implement the mandate for which they didn't even have a plan for two months.

There is also an overt political angle to all of this, where the deadline is on January 4 and conveniently bypasses the holiday shopping season. This was very clearly a politically-motivated decision by the administration, considering the U.S. has a surplus of vaccines and the ETS could have required a two-week deadline for holdouts which would have beem more than reasonable.",9,,1636990726.0,qu759r,2021-11-15 15:38:46+00:00,negative,-1

>to argue ETS due to 'grave danger'

Covid is killing for more workers than all other causes of work related deaths.  How is that not a grave danger?

>U.S. has a surplus of vaccines and the ETS could have required a two-week deadline for holdouts

That's a bold claim.  There's around 100 million unvaccinated Americans.  A significant fraction work at places that would be affected by the OSHA regulation.

If we suddenly need to vaccinate tens of millions of workers, there needs to be some logistics to make that happen.",3,,1637025382.0,qu759r,2021-11-16 01:16:22+00:00,positive,1
t1_hkswfpu,law,white_collar,comment,">So it would have been acceptable if the agency had worked on the details for 2 months, then announced it?

Yes.

Having an actual plan when announcing an emergency mandate would have put it on more solid legal ground since it would have resembled an actual ETS.

&#x200B;

>I don't see how the announcement date has any relevance to whether it's an emergency or not.

Hard for the government to argue the mandate is necessary as an *emergency* order when it isn't going to be implemented until four months after the announcement.

If something is an emergency, do you wait four months to take action?

&#x200B;

>Covid is killing for more workers than all other causes of work related deaths. How is that not a grave danger?

You're absolutely correct, so why did the Biden Administration wait two months before announcing an actual plan, and then wait another two months until it is implemented?

Again, the issue is the timing.

ETS is meant to be used for when a situation is so dire that immediate, temporary action is needed.

If it takes four months to implement an *emergency* mandate, it comes across as less of an immediately necessary action and more of a political ""workaround"" as WHCOS retweeted and the court noted.

&#x200B;

>That's a bold claim. There's around 100 million unvaccinated Americans. A significant fraction work at places that would be affected by the OSHA regulation. We have a surplus of vaccines because demand dropped off considerably. If we suddenly need to vaccinate tens of millions of workers, there needs to be some logistics to make that happen.

The U.S. has become very, very good at vaccination logistics.

Even if you think it would take longer than two weeks, it would not take two months. It is so transparent as to why the WH didn't make the deadline anytime in December.

Holding the mandate off until Jan. 4 is purely political so it doesn't disrupt the holiday shopping season and further degrades the idea this is something which requires imminent action.",2,,1637029418.0,qu759r,2021-11-16 02:23:38+00:00,negative,-1

Edit: the guy who replied to me mentioned the Emergency Management Act.  My response is

* The COVID19 emergency will be over at the point where there is sufficient vaccine supply to vaccinate the enough of the population to prevent pandemic spread of all COVID19 variants.  The possibility that subgroups might choose not to avail themselves of the vaccine doesn't mean that there's still an ongoing state-wide emergency.
* The COVID19 emergency doesn't even directly apply here.  The emergency is with regard to the effects of covid on the citizenry, not the effects of *fixing* covid on the citizenry.

If possible, ingredients that are not kosher or halal will not be used in the first place.

Maybe issues relating to fetal stem cell related research? You can circumvent that by taking one of the vaccines that weren't developed and/or produced using fetal stem cell lines. I believe the only vaccine that ever comes into contact with any stem cells is the Moderna one, and those are filtered out of the final product. The BioNTech-Pfizer vaccine was tested using fetal cell lines, but production doesn't involve them. And even then, I'd be willing to bet that a lot of anti fetal stem cell people received a vaccine that in some way involved fetal stem cells at some point in their life, or had their kids get one, without ever knowing about it because they didn't actually care to fin out about it.

t1_ha61klb,Accounting,white_collar,comment,"Very interesting since this guidance can be found on their website:

“No vaccination obligation from the employment agreement

A vaccination order is not covered by the right of direction of the employer (§ 106 GewO). Any obligation to vaccinate agreed in the employment agreement will in all likelihood also fail due to the hurdles posed by a review of general terms and conditions pursuant to sections 305 et seq. BGB, and would therefore probably be invalid. Mandatory vaccinations may also not derive from loyalty obligations of the employee towards the employer. Thus, the employer will not be able to place vaccinations of his workforce under obligation.

The employer should in any case avoid putting pressure on the employees. On the one hand, a forced vaccination is a punishable bodily injury (§ 223 StGB), on the other hand the threat of consequences and disadvantages can fulfil the criminal offence of coercion (§ 240 StGB). In particular, continued employment must not be made dependent on proof of vaccination. The employers’ possibilities are therefore limited to pointing out the advantages of voluntary vaccinations and recommending those.


Conceivable exceptional cases 

Vaccination of the employee may only be mandatory in exceptional cases. The main focus here is on medical staff in hospitals and employees in the care sector. Related to these special fields of activity, an order by the employer would be conceivable in principle, if such an intervention which a vaccination represents, would be adequate and reasonable in the individual case.”

I actually watched Joe U discuss on some major news network how employers have to find the appropriate balance between allowing employees to have autonomy over their own health choices while also making sure employees are able to feel safe in protecting themselves and their families while working outside the office, and it is definitely a delicate balance.  Introducing a few unvaccinated people into a population of vaccinated people greatly increases the risk of infection among all, and for those with unvaxxed kids or immunocompromised family at home, making the decision to vaccinate yourself is not enough to protect them if you are in constant close quarters with unvaccinated people.  Deloitte is not mandating a vaccine to be employed, they are just drawing a line to keep Deloitte offices as safe as possible- since offices have been closed most of 2020, there are still systems in place for those who want to continue working from home.  A recent survey showed that 97% of employees have already chosen to get vaccinated (probably much higher now in light of Delta surges) so the ones who are holding off are definitely in the minority so I think this was the right decision, all things considered.",1,,1629832816.0,pan5f8,2021-08-24 19:20:16+00:00,positive,1

By establishing a herd immunity you limit diseases by a) reducing the likelihood of it spreading to new hosts thanks to 95% immunity, and b) reducing the likelihood that those who are vaccinated experience serious symptoms (which also limits the spread because if you aren't coughing or sneezing, the likelihood of spreading the disease drastically reduces), and c) you limit the ability of a genetic mutation to establish itself that becomes more infectious, more dangerous, or more medication/vaccination resistant (which is why we are now dealing with the Delta variant and Lambda variant). 

Had everyone just gotten their vaccination as they became available and we surpassed 70% vaccination in the world, we'd likely have nearly eliminated COVID-19 and reduced the likelihood of variants like the Delta variant that are now running rampant. There's a reason that COVID-19 numbers dropped dramatically two-weeks and on after the vaccine became widely available in the US.

t1_gx3o4fw,Accounting,white_collar,comment,"Setting aside for a moment the politics of masks, the vaccine, and Covid-19...

In the US, your employer can hire you or fire you for nearly any reason, no matter how ridiculous, trivial, or demeaning, and without warning or advance notice (with only a few exceptions for race, gender, sometimes age, etc.).

If your boss walks up to your desk, hands you a giant chicken suit, and says effective immediately, you are now working graveyard shift, standing on the street corner dressed in a chicken costume, squaking at people and chasing away pigeons, and you can't take any bathroom or meal breaks during your entire 14 hour shift, you don't have much recourse - he can do that, as it would be perfectly legal in almost every state. 

Your employer can even cut your pay in half (as long as it's at least minimum wage or higher), charge you for ""renting"" the suit from them, and even tell you who you should vote for in the next election or require you to get the company's logo tattooed prominently on your forehead if you want to keep your job. 

However, also in the US, you are under no obligation to accept the new terms of your employment, and can immediately grab your stapler and family photos, and walk right out of the building. No two-weeks notice, no exit interview, no saving your open documents on the company's laptop - just walk right out on the spot, middle fingers raised in the air proudly behind you. 

Most employers try to do what is best for themselves, and making the work environment too inhospitable will result in employees leaving as well as bad publicity, so they tend not to make controversial requirements of their employees. However, that doesn't mean they can't (again, this post is specific to the US).

Although making a vaccination a requirement is a bit unusual, I would hope your employer did the calculations on the cost of angering some employees against the benefits they would see; for every person like you who doesn't want to get vaccinated at the moment, there's probably another employee whose heart just grew three sizes upon reading that in the company newsletter. Some employees might view that news as even better than getting a pay raise, while others might quit because of it. 

While I myself probably wouldn't make a vaccine mandatory yet if I were an employer, I think public opinion is more in favor of the vaccine than not, so the effect of their decision is probably a net positive overall, and will likely be looked upon even more favorably over time.

I don't want to sound flippant and say ""just go get the shot,"" but I've worked with a lot of businesses over the years, and requiring the Covid-19 vaccine doesn't even make my top 10 list of crazy requirements I've seen.",6,,1620265644.0,n5igse,2021-05-06 01:47:24+00:00,positive,1

I've worked my way up the ladder of accounting positions and finally became a staff accountant a few years after getting my bachelor's degree at the tender age of 36. Yes, I know I'm a late bloomer....Now almost 39, and over a year into my staff accountant role, I still feel Imposter syndrome as loud as ever. I felt this also while an accounting lead/supervisor in my previous position.

Ve uncovered the truth behind my imposter syndrome...

Because while I enjoy accounting, I hate the corporate atmosphere. I dislike the expectations between employee and employer....performance reviews, team building activities, cheesy emails with CC, BCC, BS office politics. In my office some are being criticized over whether they've been vaccinated. I cant wear perfume or have more than 1 earbud in. I hate business attire and having to pretend to be more extroverted than I am. I'm not feeling like an imposter because I'm not deserving of my role... I feel like an imposter because I dislike my role and know that there's other people in my office who would love to have my job, the job I despise a little more each day.

On that note, I am heavily studying ecommerce and would like to couple that with a  100% remote role until I can work completely independently. I don't mean to rant, but I wonder if my the cause of my imposter syndrome resonates with anyone else? Does anyone else think that maybe the imposter syndrome is a result of not liking your career?",45,27.0,1615487003.0,m2x0se,2021-03-11 18:23:23+00:00,neutral,0

Call me a quitter, I don't fucking care but Accounting and Big 4 isn't for me. I talked about how this was a mistake here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/otf27i/what\_the\_hell\_did\_i\_get\_myself\_into\_a\_story\_of\_a/h6vni3y/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/otf27i/what_the_hell_did_i_get_myself_into_a_story_of_a/h6vni3y/?context=3)

And boy did it get worse only 2 weeks later

Idk if it was the fever dream from the after effects of my J&J vaccine shot that finally broke me but  I hate all of this.

* The constantly emailing teams to follow up on stuff that they take forever on (probably cuz they get more vacation than us in the USA)
* Not understanding a damn thing about Tax, let alone Accounting.
* Being on the computer for 12 fucking hours a day.
* Being constantly corrected on everything I do. JFC, how the fuck do you expect the non-Accountant to understand these workpapers when I have no idea what's going on?
* I can barely keep up on one engagement so fuck me once they start really giving me more work.
* WFH is killing me. It's saving me gas but it's so hard to learn and ask for help now.
* Big 4 culture is sooo outdated and this is coming from someone who worked in a 60 year chemical plant with people as old as my grandpa. It's too fucking proper. Sorry I can type up a perfect email, like I'm a fucking Engineer, not a English major.

Overall, it's just awful. I don't find anything interesting. I got fucked on my investments thanks to Independence. I don't know anyone except for my contact who got me into this role.

I'm mostly pissed at myself because I only got into this because my contact (a friend) referred me (maybe it was just to get the FAT referral bonus on their end) but like, WTF, why did you think this was gonna work out? It's like, don't you know me? I also feel super bad cuz another friend of mine (former Big 4 accountant with a CPA) told me not to get into Big 4 and just take the other job offer I had but I just ignored them. Fuck I wish I had taken that other offer.

I really wanted to give this a year to see what my raise and bonus was going to be but why bother when I'm not going to want to be in a Accounting career anyway. As far as I'm concerned, it's a waste of time when I can be working somewhere getting the experience I need to be better in that career field.

So yeah, fuck me, I gotta start sending out resumes en masse and hopefully the recruiters/hiring managers will understand why I'm trying to leave a job that I have only been 2 months at.

Hey folks. I hope everyone is having a good, restful, and safe new year so far. Although 2020 is behind us, I'm sad to report that the job market is still not doing great. The obvious bad news is that COVID-19 cases are showing a second surge in most states in the U.S. and in many countries. I anticipate that there will be another surge due to large numbers of people continuing to violate public health guidelines; combined with the new, more infectious variant of COVID-19 that was discovered in the United Kingdom and has recently been detected by confirmed cases in several countries, including the United States.

You can check on how your country or state is doing using the charts below. For those of you outside the U.S., the first link covers all countries, but please cross-reference with your central government's health ministry for the most updated information.

## Macroeconomic Assessment

That said, the silver lining remains in industries that benefit from federal funding and/or are needed during the pandemic. Read around long enough and you'll find some industries have been buffered from the economic impact of the pandemic. These are typically industries that have already had their contracts approved through FY 2021, i.e. defense and Medicare — which implies that defense contractors, spaceflight, national laboratories, and medical devices may ramp up hiring despite current economic conditions.

For Americans, the recent $900 Bn stimulus passed by Congress should help buffer some of the economic impact, but the 117th Congress will likely need to pass another sizable stimulus package while the vaccination campaign against COVID-19, which has been experiencing numerous speedbumps, is ongoing and won't be widespread until Q3 2021.

However, this is just my personal view of the situation and most of it is notional based on stuff everyone can access, like the BLS jobs report. I recommend searching for recent discussions here and in r/AskEngineers to potentially form a better picture of the labor market. **Do your due diligence and ask around before making any career decisions.**

For broad macroeconomic updates I recommend visiting r/econmonitor. You'll mostly find stuff about monetary policy, but occasionally there's some insightful discussion on unemployment and the labor market in general.
